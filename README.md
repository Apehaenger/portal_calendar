- **Waveshare 7.5" 800x480 E-Ink display**
  
    Available [directly from waveshare]([foo.com](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.5inch-e-paper-hat.htm)) or [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075R4QY3L). The display itself is the Good Display GDEW075T7, Waveshare just resells it and gives you a breakout board.

- **EzSBC ESP32 breakout board**

    Available [here](https://www.ezsbc.com/product/esp32-breakout-and-development-board/). This will run on any ESP32, but this particular board is perfect for alkaline battery power due to its efficient LDO regulator and flexible input voltage. If you use a different board, you will need to modify the case and come up with your own power solution.

- **4xAAA battery holder**

    Pretty much all of them will work. [This is a good one.](https://www.pololu.com/product/1145/specs)
